Repair mode for repository via-decide/decide.engine-tools.

TARGET
Validate and repair only the files touched by the previous implementation.

TASK
Add a new standalone tool called tetris-game in tools/games/tetris-game/. Title: "Tetris Game". Description: "Falling block puzzle with rotation and line clears.". Category: "games". The tool must contain: config.json, index.html, tool.js. The game must run in browser, use vanilla JS, have simple UI, no external frameworks. Register in shared/tool-registry.js importableToolDirs array. Add to router.js modularTools map. Ensure index.html dynamic render picks it up. Add to README.md tool list.

RULES
1. Audit touched files first and identify regressions.
2. Preserve architecture and naming conventions.
3. Make minimal repairs only; do not expand scope.
4. Re-run checks and provide concise root-cause notes.
5. Return complete contents for changed files only.

REPO CONTEXT
- README snippet:
# Decide Engine Tools + Orchard Engine Foundation

This repository is a preservation-first browser-native tool mesh by **ViaDecide**.

It hosts standalone decision and productivity tools that run directly in the browser with no build step, plus the **Orchard Engine** — a merit-based farming-career game system.

## Preservation-first policy

- Existing standalone tools are preserved.
- New systems are additive.
- No unrelated folder is deleted or replaced.
- Tools remain standalone HTML/CSS/JS.

## Tool categories

Tools are organized into 9 categories. The index page at `index.html` renders them grouped automatically from registry metadata.

| Category | Tools |
|---|---|
| **Creators** | PromptAlchemy, Script Generator |
| **Coders** | Code Generator, Code Reviewer, Agent Builder, App Generator |
| **Researchers** | Multi Source Research, Student Research |
| **Business** | Sales Dashbo
- AGENTS snippet:

4. Prefer additive changes.
5. Tools must remain standalone HTML apps.
