You are working in repository via-decide/decide.engine-tools on branch main.

MISSION
Create the Dynamic Plugin Host & Sandbox (via-plugin-host). 1. Build a core backend registry that dynamically discovers, loads, and initializes all the other engine tools (Audio, ECS, Cinematics) as modular plugins. 2. Implement a sandboxing architecture that catches and isolates fatal errors. If the Shader Graph tool crashes due to a bad regex, it should *not* crash the ECS tool or the main Operations Console. 3. Write a lifecycle manager that controls the boot sequence (Init, Load Dependencies, Update Loop, Shutdown) for every loaded module.

CONSTRAINTS
Commit the manifest parser, the error-boundary isolator, and the lifecycle manager separately. @GN8RBot MUST program unit tests that intentionally throw fatal errors in dummy plugins to verify the host survives.

PROCESS (MANDATORY)
1. Read README.md and AGENTS.md before editing.
2. Audit architecture before coding. Summarize current behavior.
3. Preserve unrelated working code. Prefer additive modular changes.
4. Implement the smallest safe change set for the stated goal.
5. Run validation commands and fix discovered issues.
6. Self-review for regressions, missing env wiring, and docs drift.
7. Return complete final file contents for every modified or created file.

REPO AUDIT CONTEXT
- Description: 
- Primary language: HTML
- README snippet:
# Decide Engine Tools + Orchard Engine Foundation This repository is a preservation-first browser-native tool mesh by **ViaDecide**. It hosts standalone decision and productivity tools that run directly in the browser with no build step, plus the **Orchard Engine** — a merit-based farming-career g

- AGENTS snippet:
Rules for coding agents in this repository: 1. Never delete tool folders. 2. Never remove working code from tools. 3. Never replace a tool with a placeholder. 4. Prefer additive changes. 5. Tools must remain standalone HTML apps. 6. Routing must never break existing tools. 7. If reorganizing tools,
ENGINE-TOOLS ARCHITECTURE (mandatory compliance)
Tool directory: tools/<tool>/
Required files: config.json, index.html, tool.js
Shared dependencies to import: shared/tool-storage.js, shared/shared.css
config.json must include: id, name, description, category, audience, inputs, outputs, tags
Registration: append "tools/<tool>" to importableToolDirs[] in shared/tool-registry.js
Router: add tool ID → entry path to static map in router.js
Do NOT modify any existing tool folder or shared utility file.
Do NOT use external frameworks, CDN packages, or bundlers.

SOP: PRE-MODIFICATION PROTOCOL (MANDATORY)
1. Adherence to Instructions: No deviations without explicit user approval.
2. Mandatory Clarification: Immediately ask if instructions are ambiguous or incomplete.
3. Proposal First: Always propose optimizations or fixes before implementing them.
4. Scope Discipline: Do not add unrequested features or modify unrelated code.
5. Vulnerability Check: Immediately flag and explain security risks.

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS
- Include: implementation summary, checks run, risks, rollback notes.
- Generate branch + PR package.
- Keep prompts deterministic and preservation-first.
