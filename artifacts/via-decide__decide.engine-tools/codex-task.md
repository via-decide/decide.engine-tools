MISSION
Build a global GlassModalController for dynamic context injection. 1. Create shared/glass-modal.js. 2. Implement a globally accessible GlassModal.open(title, contentHTML, actionButtons) method. 3. The method must target (or inject) a .modal.panel-glass container overlaying the grid background. 4. It should inject the title (using the Syne font stack), the contentHTML (using DM Mono), and render the actionButtons. 5. If an action button has type: 'critical', apply the .btn-glitch CSS class to it automatically. 6. Add event listeners to close the modal on an outside click or 'Escape' key press, fading out the .panel-glass smoothly.

CONSTRAINTS
There should only ever be ONE glass modal in the DOM at a time to save memory. Re-use the same DOM node and just swap the innerHTML and event listeners.

PROCESS (MANDATORY)
1. Read README.md and AGENTS.md before editing.
2. Audit architecture before coding. Summarize current behavior.
3. Preserve unrelated working code. Prefer additive modular changes.
4. Implement the smallest safe change set for the stated goal.
5. Run validation commands and fix discovered issues.
6. Self-review for regressions, missing env wiring, and docs drift.
7. Return complete final file contents for every modified or created file.

ENGINE-TOOLS ARCHITECTURE (mandatory compliance)
Tool directory: tools/<tool>/
Required files: config.json, index.html, tool.js
Shared dependencies to import: shared/tool-storage.js, shared/shared.css
config.json must include: id, name, description, category, audience, inputs, outputs, tags
Registration: append "tools/<tool>" to importableToolDirs[] in shared/tool-registry.js
Router: add tool ID → entry path to static map in router.js
Do NOT modify any existing tool folder or shared utility file.
Do NOT use external frameworks, CDN packages, or bundlers.

SOP: PRE-MODIFICATION PROTOCOL (MANDATORY)
1. Adherence to Instructions: No deviations without explicit user approval.
2. Mandatory Clarification: Immediately ask if instructions are ambiguous or incomplete.
3. Proposal First: Always propose optimizations or fixes before implementing them.
4. Scope Discipline: Do not add unrequested features or modify unrelated code.
5. Vulnerability Check: Immediately flag and explain security risks.

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS
- Include: implementation summary, checks run, risks, rollback notes.
- Generate branch + PR package.
- Keep prompts deterministic and preservation-first.
