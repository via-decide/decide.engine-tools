You are working in repository via-decide/decide.engine-tools on branch main.

MISSION
Develop the Timeline Track & Keyframe Editor UI (via-timeline-ui). 1. Build a sophisticated HTML5/Canvas Timeline Editor within the Operations Console, featuring draggable keyframes and scrubbable playheads. 2. Implement a visual "Graph Editor" view where designers can manually tweak the tangent handles of Bezier curves for easing in/out. 3. Create an event-dispatch system that synchronizes the web-based timeline playhead with the local engine's rendering context in real-time.

CONSTRAINTS
Commit the Canvas drawing logic, the keyframe drag-and-drop handler, and the tangent math as separate modules. The Graph Editor UI components must be built and committed piece-by-piece to safely inflate the commit graph.

PROCESS (MANDATORY)
1. Read README.md and AGENTS.md before editing.
2. Audit architecture before coding. Summarize current behavior.
3. Preserve unrelated working code. Prefer additive modular changes.
4. Implement the smallest safe change set for the stated goal.
5. Run validation commands and fix discovered issues.
6. Self-review for regressions, missing env wiring, and docs drift.
7. Return complete final file contents for every modified or created file.

REPO AUDIT CONTEXT
- Description: 
- Primary language: HTML
- README snippet:
# Decide Engine Tools + Orchard Engine Foundation This repository is a preservation-first browser-native tool mesh by **ViaDecide**. It hosts standalone decision and productivity tools that run directly in the browser with no build step, plus the **Orchard Engine** — a merit-based farming-career g

- AGENTS snippet:
Rules for coding agents in this repository: 1. Never delete tool folders. 2. Never remove working code from tools. 3. Never replace a tool with a placeholder. 4. Prefer additive changes. 5. Tools must remain standalone HTML apps. 6. Routing must never break existing tools. 7. If reorganizing tools,
ENGINE-TOOLS ARCHITECTURE (mandatory compliance)
Tool directory: tools/<tool>/
Required files: config.json, index.html, tool.js
Shared dependencies to import: shared/tool-storage.js, shared/shared.css
config.json must include: id, name, description, category, audience, inputs, outputs, tags
Registration: append "tools/<tool>" to importableToolDirs[] in shared/tool-registry.js
Router: add tool ID → entry path to static map in router.js
Do NOT modify any existing tool folder or shared utility file.
Do NOT use external frameworks, CDN packages, or bundlers.

SOP: PRE-MODIFICATION PROTOCOL (MANDATORY)
1. Adherence to Instructions: No deviations without explicit user approval.
2. Mandatory Clarification: Immediately ask if instructions are ambiguous or incomplete.
3. Proposal First: Always propose optimizations or fixes before implementing them.
4. Scope Discipline: Do not add unrequested features or modify unrelated code.
5. Vulnerability Check: Immediately flag and explain security risks.

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS
- Include: implementation summary, checks run, risks, rollback notes.
- Generate branch + PR package.
- Keep prompts deterministic and preservation-first.
